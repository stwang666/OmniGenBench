    "\n",
    "Let's visualize the architecture. At its core, our model consists of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Base Model**: This is a large, pre-trained transformer model (like OmniGenome-186M) that has been trained on a massive amount of unlabeled genomic data. Its job is to read a DNA sequence (as a series of tokens) and convert it into a rich numerical representation (an embedding). This embedding captures the complex syntax and semantics of the genomic language.\n",
    "2.  **The Task Head**: This is a smaller, simple neural network (usually just one or two linear layers) that sits on top of the base model. It takes the sequence embedding from the base model and transforms it into the desired output format for our specific task. For our TFB problem, this is a **multi-label classification head**.\n",
