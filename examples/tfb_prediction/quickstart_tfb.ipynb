    "# 🧬 Transcription Factor Binding Prediction with OmniGenBench\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial where we'll explore how to predict Transcription Factor Binding (TFB) sites on DNA sequences using **OmniGenBench**. This guide focuses on the specific biological problem of transcription factor binding prediction and demonstrates the practical application of genomic deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📚 **Prerequisites**: If you're new to OmniGenBench, we strongly recommend starting with the **[Fundamental Concepts Tutorial](../../00_fundamental_concepts.ipynb)**. It covers essential topics including language model concepts, machine learning task classification, genomic foundation model principles, and other foundational knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Biological Challenge: What is Transcription Factor Binding?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transcription Factors (TFs)** are essential proteins that regulate gene expression, the process of turning genes 'on' or 'off'. They do this by binding to specific DNA sequences. Identifying these binding sites is a critical step in understanding gene regulation, which is fundamental to comprehending cellular function, development, and disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, experimentally identifying TF binding sites across the entire genome is a slow and expensive process. This is where computational methods, particularly deep learning, can make a significant impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Data: An Introduction to the DeepSEA Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a model for this task, we need a labeled dataset. We will use the **DeepSEA dataset**, a well-known benchmark in genomics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it contains**: It consists of 1000-base-pair DNA sequences.\n",
    "- **What it labels**: Each sequence is associated with 919 binary labels. These labels indicate the presence or absence of various chromatin features, including TF binding, DNase I sensitivity, and histone marks.\n",
    "- **Our Goal**: We will use these sequences and labels to train a model that can predict which of the 919 features are present for any given DNA sequence.\n",
