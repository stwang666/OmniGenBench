# **OmniGenBench**: From Static Genomic Foundation Models to Dynamic Research Ecosystem

## 1· The Old Paradigm: The Limitation of Static Genomic Foundation Models

Large-scale pre-trained Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) ushered in a major leap forward, yet most arrived as **static artifacts**—competent but inflexible. A model released to predict transcription-factor binding, for example, did *only* that.

**The fundamental challenges were:**

- **Inflexibility** — Adapting a GFM to a new task (e.g., viral-promoter effects, enhancer-promoter interactions) required deep code-level surgery and heavy engineering effort.  
- **Fragmented Ecosystem** — A “one model, one task” landscape forced researchers to hunt for ever-new, single-purpose tools.  
- **Untapped Potential** — The rich, generalizable “genomic grammar” learned by GFMs remained locked away, unused beyond their narrow original scope.

## 2· The New Paradigm: OmniGenBench as the Catalyst for *Exploiting* Foundational Models

A **true** foundation model should be a *starting point*, not a finished product—an extensible platform that invites new, even unforeseen, biological questions.

**OmniGenBench** was built precisely to unlock this potential.  
It transforms static GFMs into **adaptable, multi-purpose research engines**, making extensibility the default so any scientist can innovate without touching core framework code.

## 3· The Mechanism: How OmniGenBench Achieves Seamless Extensibility

OmniGenBench uses a clean, object-oriented architecture—think flexible “lego bricks” rather than a rigid pipeline:

| Building Block | Purpose |
| -------------- | ------- |
| `OmniDataset`  | Load & preprocess *any* genomic data format |
| `OmniModel`    | Attach new task-specific “heads” to a pre-trained backbone |
| `Trainer`      | Handle model loading, batching, training loops, evaluation |

**To add a new task, a researcher merely:**

1. **Defines a custom `OmniDataset`** for their data.  
2. **Defines a custom `OmniModel`** (e.g., classification, regression, or bespoke architecture).  

The heavy lifting—backbone management, batching, distributed training—is abstracted away.

## 4· From Theory to Practice: Demonstrating Unmatched Extensibility

OmniGenBench’s flexibility is proven across diverse examples:

### • Proof Point 1 — Complex Fine-Tuning for a New Task  
By adding a multi-label head and a custom dataset class, a standard GFM becomes a high-performance, multi-label transcription-factor–binding predictor—no framework edits required.

### • Proof Point 2 — Novel Zero-Shot Application  
In Variant Effect Prediction, embeddings from a frozen backbone are compared between reference and alternate alleles, enabling functional impact prediction **without any task-specific training**.

### • Proof Point 3 — Overcoming Practical Barriers  
With a single configuration dictionary, researchers apply LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning, adapting **billion-parameter** models on a single GPU—previously out of reach for most labs.

## 5· Conclusion: A Unique and Necessary Framework for Modern Genomics

OmniGenBench is **not** just a model hub or a training-script wrapper—it is a paradigm shift. By turning GFMs into living, extensible platforms, it empowers scientists to move beyond pre-defined tasks and invent novel solutions to pressing biological problems. To our knowledge, **no other genomics framework offers this depth of seamless, practical extensibility**—making OmniGenBench essential for realizing the full promise of foundation models in genomics.
